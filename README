Budget calculates a fortnightly budget passed off of a list of expenses. These expenses are stored as a JSON file managed via tinyDB.

An expense should have the following fields:
    'title' : title of the expense.
    'cost' : cost of the expense
    'priority' : how important the expense is. This should be a whole number between 0 (least important) and 9 (most important)
    'interval' : how often this should be paid. Should be a string with a value of 'weekly', 'fortnightly', or 'monthly'
